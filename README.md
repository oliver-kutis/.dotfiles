# Introduction
Creation of this repository is motivated the fact that I've started to use
Alacritty terminal and Neovim.

## alacritty (terminal)
The entire alacritty config is mostly based on this [article](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-alacritty-terminal) 

## .p10k.zsh (custom zsh terminal)
Making the terminal less boring :D

## nvim 
Lots of config, plugins, ...
At the time of creation of this repo, I'm completely new to Neovim.
