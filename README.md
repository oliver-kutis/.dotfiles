# Introduction

Creation of this repository is motivated the fact that I've started to use
Alacritty terminal and Neovim.

## alacritty (terminal)

The entire alacritty config is mostly based on this [article](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-alacritty-terminal)

## .p10k.zsh (custom zsh terminal)

Making the terminal less boring :D

## nvim

Lots of config, plugins, ...
This again was configured with help of this [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM)
and this [article](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-neovim-2024)

At the time of creation of this repo, I'm completely new to Neovim.
