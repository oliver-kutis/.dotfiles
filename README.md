# Introduction

Creation of this repository is motivated the fact that I've started to use
Alacritty terminal and Neovim.

One resource that really helped me with this is the video from Fireship:

## alacritty (terminal)

The entire alacritty config is mostly based on this [article](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-alacritty-terminal)

To configure ability to have itallic fonts, I used this [guide](https://michenriksen.com/posts/italic-text-in-alacritty-tmux-neovim/)

## .p10k.zsh (custom zsh terminal)

Making the terminal less boring :D

## nvim

Lots of config, plugins, ...
This again was configured with help of this [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM)
and this [article](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-neovim-2024)

At the time of creation of this repo, I'm completely new to Neovim.
